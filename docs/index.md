## How to use Service Creation

This backend service leverages the provided GitLab and Jenkins APIs in order to authenticate a User and create a new repository based on the options selected by the User. Furthermore, depending on the Userâ€™s choices, the newly created repository can be paired with a Jenkins CI/CD. 
The component creates a new Jenkins CI/CD pipeline and then performs the necessary configuration actions (webhooks, ect.) in order to complete the pairing process. As a result, the process is completed automatically, thus sparing the User from the manual use and configuration of the external tools.

The service includes two endpoints:

**Endpoint 1:** "/createStructure" -> creates a GitLab repository.

**projectName** -> String    
**projVisibility** -> String    
**projDescription** -> String    
**gitLabServerURL** -> String    
**gitlabToken** -> String


**Endpoint 2:** "/createStuctureJenkins" -> creates a GitLab repository and a Jenkins pipeline and finaly configures and pairs them.    
**Request parameters:**    
**projectName** -> String    
**projVisibility** -> String    
**projDescription** -> String    
**gitLabServerURL** -> String
